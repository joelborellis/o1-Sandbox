8.  We also need a second image, this image should be a picture of the stadium that the the college football team The Longhorns plays.

9.  To find the number of people this stadium holds multiply the number of people on the Titanic by 40.

10.  This image should be added to the same html code as the first image.

11.  Store the updated code as rabbits.html in cwd

12.  Then the customer wants to style the rabbits.html code to look like a retro pop art website with extremely good reliability using css.

13.  Again store the code as rabbits.html in cwd.

14.  Finally add some information to the rabbits.html code to fit and siaplay the images side by side in the center of the page, and add captions to the images.
